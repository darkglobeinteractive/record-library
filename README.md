# Record Library App

This app consumes a Google Sheet that is published to the web as a CSV file. The spreadsheet consists of a list of LPs that I own along with some notes on the item's condition, specifications and origins. The app allows me to reference my collection while browsing records.

# Development Notes

My focus was to utilize core state rather than use Redux and any middleware. After recently relying on Redux, React Redux and Redux Thunk I decided I wanted to put some basic techniques into practice.
